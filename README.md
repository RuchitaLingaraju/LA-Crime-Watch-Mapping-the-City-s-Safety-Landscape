## 📌 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Methods**  
### **1️⃣ Crime Density Heatmaps**  
- Displays **high-crime areas across Los Angeles**.  
- Helps identify **long-term crime hotspots**.  

📌 **Examples:**  
- Downtown LA and Inglewood crime clusters.  
- Geographic shifts in crime patterns over time.  

### **2️⃣ Time-Based Crime Trends**  
- Analyzes crime distribution **by hour and year**.  
- Identifies peak hours for different crime types.  

📌 **Examples:**  
- High crime rates at **noon and 6 PM (rush hours)**.  
- Decline in crime activity after midnight.  

### **3️⃣ Weapon-Related Offenses**  
- Examines **firearm, blunt object, and assault-related incidents**.  
- Highlights weapon distribution and severity of offenses.  

📌 **Examples:**  
- **Air pistols and revolvers** are the most frequently used weapons.  
- **Battery and assault crimes** dominate the weapon-related offenses.  

### **4️⃣ Premise-Based Crime Analysis**  
- Maps **crime distribution by location type**.  
- Identifies high-crime settings like **alleys, abandoned buildings, and apartments**.  

📌 **Examples:**  
- **Alleys** have the highest number of crimes (20.74K cases).  
- **Residential crimes** highlight concerns over **domestic violence and home invasions**.
